<p>Project Cygnus is a code base that aims at recreating the CubeWorld experience, while creating a new experience for seasoned CubeWorld players.</p>

<p>The game is entirely open source, but the code and content is under Copyright.
If you're interested in using any of the code or content found in this project, please read the "Licensing" section.</p>

<p>Also, the name "Project Cygnus" is by no means final, and is due to change in the near future, before the game is released.</p>

<h4>
<a id="dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h4>

<ol>
<li>The game is built around Unity3D. The project must be opened in a Unity3D environment of 5.3.4 or later in order to run and compile.</li>
<li>At its current stage, the game uses VisionPunk's Ultimate FPS package for Unity, which is licensed software. Certain mechanics are built around UFPS such as playermovement and input management.

<ul>
<li>The dependancy on UFPS will eventually be replaced with our own player movement and input managers. It isn't a major priority at the moment but it will happen eventually!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Debugging and fixing issues found in the game can be difficult when you're also trying to implement new features in a timely fashion.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>If you're interested in fixing bugs, introducing planned features, or proposing new ones, please read the "Fork Rules" section.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If you're interested in reporting bugs, send me an e-mail. You MUST have a video attached or linked which shows every step to reproduce the bug at least two times in a row. Make the subject of your e-mail "Cygnus - Bug Report" and make sure to include the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>The Version/Build Number of the game, which can be found in the log file if you Ctrl+F "game_version", or in the bottom right corner of the game's window.</li>
<li>Platform - Windows/Linux/Mac etc</li>
<li>Bug description:

<ul>
<li>Reproduceable steps: Clearly define the steps it takes to reproduce the bug.</li>
<li>Expected result: How is the game supposed to respond?</li>
<li>Actual result: What is the actual response from the game?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A link to a video</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're interested in requesting or suggesting new features:</p>

<ul>
<li>At the moment, only forked changes and feature suggestions will be considered.</li>
<li>If you don't have programming experience or the time to develop your idea, then wait until we have a considerable forum and community in order to manage threads for new ideas and concepts.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>
<a id="fork-rules" class="anchor" href="#fork-rules" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Fork Rules</h4>

<ol>
<li>All code that is not immediately comprehensible, meaning it doesn't read with ease, should be explained in a comment.</li>
<li>Timestamp all comments that explain functionality, propose or explain ideas, or in comments that are longer than 2 lines.

<ul>
<li>Timestamp format: "-Initials Date".</li>
<li>Example: "-TH 4/20/2016".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Follow the coding conventions found in the game's source code.

<ul>
<li>All member and variable names must be lower_case_with_under_scores</li>
<li>All type names (structs, classes, enums, delegates) must be Upper_Camel_Case_With_Under_Scores</li>
<li>Tight single-line if statements and loops should usually be capture in a single line without braces, unless the resulting line is very long.</li>
<li>All member, variable and type names should be easy to read and understand. Local variable names are less important.</li>
<li>The english language only, please. Changes made that aren't in english probably won't be accepted in an official build.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
